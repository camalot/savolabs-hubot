# Description:
#   Notifies about any available GitHub repo event via webhook #
# Configuration:
#   HUBOT_POWERUP_ROOMS  - The default rooms to which message should go (optional)
#   HUBOT_GITHUB_EVENT_NOTIFIER_TYPES - Comma-separated list of event types to notify on
#   HUBOT_POWERUP_BRANCH - Comma-separated list of event types to notify on
#   (See: http://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events)
#
#   You will have to do the following:
#   1. Create a new webhook for your `myuser/myrepo` repository at:
#    https://github.com/myuser/myrepo/settings/hooks/new
#
#   2. Select the individual events to minimize the load on your Hubot.
#
#   3. Add the url: <HUBOT_URL>:<PORT>/hubot/gh-repo-events[?room=<room>]
#    (Don't forget to urlencode the room name, especially for IRC. Hint: # = %23)
#
# Commands:
#   None
#
# URLS:
#   POST /hubot/gh-repo-events?room=<room>
#
# Notes:
#   Currently tested with the following event types in HUBOT_GITHUB_EVENT_NOTIFIER_TYPES:
#     - issue
#     - page_build
#     - pull_request
#     - push
#
# Authors:
#   spajus
#   patcon
#   parkr
